Micropython METAR Aviation Weather Checker

This app is built to run on the Cardputer by M5Stack.  It should be fairly easy to port it to PicoDisplay/Pico W as well, as the screen dimensions are the same, and the project started on that device.  For this to run on your Cardputer, you'll need Micropython installed, which in my experience is best accomplished by installing the MicroHydra custom firmware via the M5Burner firmware flashing tool from M5Stack.  You will then need to follow the project instructions here to download the files and put them on the device with Thonny: https://github.com/AskewedBox/Cardputer-MicroHydra/tree/main

Another known issue is that this currently will only launch when launched from Thonny on a computer connected to the Cardputer.  You can then disconnect your device and use the app.  Attempting to resolve this issue.
